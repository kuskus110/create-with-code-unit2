# Hungry Animals
A small game, made with Unity, as a part of my game dev learing process.

[My game on Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-183654)

## Description
I made this game as a part of the "[Create with code](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-2-basic-gameplay)" course on Unity Learn website.

I did everything by myself, including the bonus challanges. (except the assets)

## Disclaimer
I made this game within a week only for the purpose of learning new Unity and game dev skills. So I didn't put an effort in code polish, code design, code conventions...
I wanted to invest my time only in learning, I know my code and my project structure could be better.

## Help me learn and improve
If you are an experienced Unity developer or C# developer, I would be very glad to recieve comments and review about my project and code. Help me learn :)
